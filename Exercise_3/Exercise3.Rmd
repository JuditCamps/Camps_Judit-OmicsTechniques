```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First of all we have to read the targets:

```{r}
targets <- read.delim("~/Documents/BDBI/2n/3r_trim/Omics_Techniques/Camps_Judit-OmicsTechniques/Exercise_3/GSE107741/data/targets.txt")
print(targets)
```

Now we would have to read the CEL files, but as the used dataset doesn't have these type of files, the expression set will be used:

```{r}
# In the case of having CEL files:
# require(oligo)
# celFiles <- list.celfiles("./data", full.names = TRUE)

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
BiocManager::install("HsAgilentDesign023647.db")
require(HsAgilentDesign023647.db)
columns(HsAgilentDesign023647.db)

probesAvsB <- rownames(topTab_AvsB)[1:10]
anotAvsB <- select(hgu133a.db, probesAvsB, columns = c("ENTREZID", "SYMBOL", "GENENAME"))
```
